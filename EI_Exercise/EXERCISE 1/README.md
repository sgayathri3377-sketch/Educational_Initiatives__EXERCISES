# üìÅ EXERCISE 1: Design Patterns Showcase

This directory contains **Exercise 1**, which is designed to demonstrate the practical application of various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and **Design Patterns** across the three main categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. The exercise includes six distinct use cases to showcase the benefits of each pattern.

## üéØ Focus Areas
* **OOP & SOLID Principles:** Applying fundamental OOP concepts (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism) and the SOLID principles to ensure flexible and maintainable code.
* **Design Patterns:** Implementing a diverse set of patterns to address common software design problems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implemented Design Patterns & Use Cases

| Pattern Category | Pattern | Space-Themed Use Case | Core Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Behavioral** | Observer Pattern | Space Weather Monitoring | Decouples the subject (weather) from its dependents (modules). |
| **Behavioral** | Strategy Pattern | Spacecraft Propulsion | Allows an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. |
| **Creational** | Singleton Pattern | Mission Control Center | Guarantees a single instance of a critical class. |
| **Creational** | Factory Pattern | Spacecraft Factory | Centralizes object creation without specifying the exact class. |
| **Structural** | Adapter Pattern | Alien Communication | Enables communication between incompatible interfaces. |
| **Structural** | Composite Pattern | Space Station Modules | Allows clients to treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  Navigate to the `EXERCISE 1` directory.
2.  Compile the Java files.
3.  Run the main class to see the demonstrations of all six design patterns in action.
